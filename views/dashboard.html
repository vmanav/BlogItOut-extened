                            What is Lorem Ipsum?
                            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
                            been
                            the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
                            galley
                            of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
                            centuries,
                            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                            popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                            passages,
                            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
                            of
                            Lorem Ipsum.

                            Why do we use it?
                            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
                            page
                            when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
                            normal
                            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
                            like
                            readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
                            as
                            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still
                            in
                            their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
                            sometimes on
                            purpose (injected humour and the like).

                            Where does it come from?
                            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
                            of
                            classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                            Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                            Latin
                            words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                            classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                            1.10.32
                            and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                            written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                            Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
                            line in
                            section 1.10.32.

            What is Lorem Ipsum?
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
            the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
            of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
